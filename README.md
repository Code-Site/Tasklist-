# Tasklist-
This is a terminal application "Tasklist". This is a free time fun project, people who are really new to coding can try this up! You can manage tasks for each day of the week by setting up tasks! 

**Use 'taskcreate' command to create new tasks, by default it stores tasks for the exact day when you are creating the tasks, say you're creating a task on monday, then it gets stored on monday 
**Use 'taskshow' command to show task for any specific day 
**Use 'tasktrash' to delete all tasks for a particular day
